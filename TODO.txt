# TODO


1. Pass more parameters to customize the results
  * current location
  * radius (need to convert to miles)
  * opennow
  * Check the link for more info https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search#PlaceSearchRequests
2. Add distance metric. Use google distance matrix api to calculate the distance between current location and each location
3. Get place photo and put it beside each output
4. Build an algorithm for figuring out which place to go to based on preference inputs
  * location (1-5)
  * foods choices (rank food choices)
  * price
  * rating
